                        The project involves the regeneration of the abandoned remains of a disused train station in Ħamrun. 
                        Ħamrun is a town which takes pride in its intangible heritage, which ranges from var shows to carnival festivities to an annual celebration of saints in its streets. 
                        The old train station is an opportunity to give permanence to the intangible by providing space from the preparation of these same events: for instance, the sowing and designing of carnival costumes and the restoration of statues for the local feast. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text op hide" id="3">
                        The scale and physicality of the train station allows for five distinguished spaces to be proposed: 
                        the worktop space; the large open space; the market space; the kitchen and the social seating space. 
                        Therefore, a dynamic programme is proposed, where the assigned use of a particular area depends on the Ħamrun’s intangible calendar year.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text op hide" id="6">
                        These spaces are designed around the old train station’s architectural values of linearity, openness and its past social value as a connector of people and places. It is a multilevel approach taking the form of a structured route through a series of platforms from one level to another. This creates a multilayered environment which flows through the whole station, embracing movement, visibility and engagement. 
                        Thus, this allows for a connection between one space and another – meaning a connection between working groups and visitors that are utilising the spaces for the preparation of these intangible heritage events. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text op hide" id="11">
                        Considering the train station’s current context: the scouts, the neighbouring primary school and the elderly care home, the proposal becomes an opportunity to engage these present institutions into the new working environment. 
                        By allowing working and recreational spaces for these groups, the train station is now a place for the interaction with other groups from the town who are using the space, thus igniting interest and awareness about Ħamrun’s intangible heritage.
                        </p>
